### Why not just sell my products on Etsy marketplace?
Honestly, if you can sell on Etsy marketplace you should. It's a great place to get impulsive purchases from people who might be browsing. However, when you tell people to seek you out specifically why would you want to point them to a page that features a competitors product right next to yours? Etsy is a great place to get referral traffic, but you don't want to send people there directly. You want all the attention.

This static site has an option to include Wordpress as a headless CMS, and with that you can still use all of the plugins available including a service called Sellberry. It integrates your inventory across your site and various marketplaces where you can leverage that potential referral traffic without having to possibly loose a customer you pitched personally. That's a problem I'm here to help you solve.
