It might have been that back in the day, eBay was the best place to reach a wide market of interested customers. Over time though, eBays reputation has diminished with sellers due to burdensome requirements. Online reviews from sellers claim that they are required to accept returns and refund the money even when the returned item is damaged when shipped back. While that's worth verifying from eBays Terms and Conditions specifically, that should be a major red flag for anyone invested in shipping inventory. Other  marketplaces with similarly poor reviews from sellers include Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, and Offer Up. While it's not impossible to sell an instrument on these marketplace by any means, there are many low-ballers and other resellers looking to make a profit from goods found in digital swapmeets and yard sales. The best thing you can do as a seller is to find a market that caters towards your niche. If you trade in musical instruments, that means you want to go to Reverb.

One of the biggest tools reverb offers its sellers is a price guide that provides a price chart for specific makes and models. It specifically shows users the price an instrument sold for rather than the listing price. Most musicians will know its rare to find an instrument listed at 50% of its retail value, but with this tool you can measure more precisely how a certain piece appreciates or depreciates. Even if you don't choose to ship an item through Reverb, it's smart to price check when possible to know what your item is worth (for better or worse).

Another big advantage to using Reverb for selling is that the audience is more educated on what they are searching for and will be the actual people playing the instrument instead of flipping them for a profit. The end user is always the sellers target customer if they expect to get the best price for their goods. It won't require you to know everything about your specific product, but the more you find out about what you're selling, the less likely you are to have the price haggled down under sales pressure. Many sellers will like a courtesy phone call to answer any questions and ease concerns, especially when a guitar can cost over $5,000 in some cases. Because of the risk involved with the dollar amounts, it's always recommeded that you follow these practices.

1. Always get the package insured to cover the cost of the item being destroyed potentially.
2. Always require a signature on delivery, or risk loosing the shipment.
3. If a recipient cannot sign for an item, deliver it to a UPS store or similar 3rd party shop to verify that the correct person signs for and receives their shipment.
4. Have the correct packaging in-hand before you even list the guitar.
5. Always give your package the 'shake test' to ensure that no items will get loose during transport.

### Shipping packaging

If you're shipping a one off guitar it would be useful to check out your local guitar shop to see when their trucks bring in new shipments of instruments. They can provide you with premium packaging that they pull off of new guitars before hanging them on the wall for display. It can't be gauranteed that you'll find the exact model or correct inserts to go with it however, and it may take some creativity to get your package to pass the 'shake test'. The professional solution is to buy [premium packaging from StewMac](https://www.stewmac.com/luthier-tools-and-supplies/supplies/guitar-shipping/electric-guitar-shipping-system-for-guitars-without-cases.html) so that you aren't relying on the kindness of strangers, but the consistency of commerce. It may cost extra at first, but that cost is passed along to the consumer with the other shipping costs.
