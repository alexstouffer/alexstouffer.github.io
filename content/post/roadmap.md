Private music teachers found themselves in an interesting situation last year during COVID-19 Pandemic shutdowns. They found that their jobs as they knew them had been destabilized as long they required that the money needed to be made from teaching students in person at a physical location. Many adapted quickly and began teaching courses through Zoom, Skype, and other video conferencing apps that allowed two musicians to play for eachother from remote locations. Paired with cash apps like Venmo and PayPal, it removed friction from payments and allowed guitar teachers to reach farther. They no longer needed to travel in order to meet with students. 

Those who were good about marketing their services online began to develop and sell independently made coursework for beginners or intermediately skilled people attempting to hone specific skills within their field of expertise. Music teachers, web designers and physical trainers found a common thread that would allow them to earn more revenue by selling to a wider audience. Still, while many are buying these courses to better themselves, there is still a group of people that feel uncomfortable without being helped along their educational journey. They still feel the need for one-on-one instruction.

That's where a golden opportunity awaits savvy instructors. By recording their students lessons and placing them behind a paywall, they create an additional income stream that allows their students to review content on-demand. It also incentivizes students to continue paying for access to these files even if they temporarily stop taking lessons real-time for an extended period of time. It's not a very sophisticated tool at the moment, but our minimum viable product looks like this.

### Our Standard User Story

1. A teacher creates an account through our platform.
2. The teacher installs software on their local machine that listens for updates on a folder where the teacher uploads all lessons per student name (a student folder).
3. The teacher chooses whether to keep the files or delete them after they upload to the server.
4. They configure zoom to choose where to save each recording, before meeting with their next student.
5. They offer a student access to the video repo via unique ID or email.

I will most likely store the videos on Amazon Web Services for the time being, and should be able to allow teachers to download the content that they upload. More information to follow once I've built a tangible MVP.
