      <description>WordPress Sites account for ~40% of all websites and ~60% of all sites that use a Content Management System. Despite the overwhelming adoption, WordPress has some significant disadvantages that could be overcome with Next.js:
Slow page speeds &amp;amp; Poor SEO ranking Wordpress can be excellent when optimized by a skilled developer, and maybe that&amp;rsquo;s your case. However for every 1 site that&amp;rsquo;s optimized there are at least a dozen that aren&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <title>Project Retrospective: Art Shop eCommerce on JAMstack</title>

      <description>This has been my favorite project to work on. Using the JAMStack made it particularly enjoyable. It was my first time building an application this way, but it is rewarding on multiple levels: I&amp;rsquo;ve helped an artist succeed as an entrepreneur, built a product almost any business can start with, and saw valuable opportunities to extend on it.
This site uses two hosted GitHub page repos based on code published by CommerceLayer for use with their API.</description>

      <title>Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and Crypto&#39;s Future For the Music Industry</title>

      <description>One of the biggest critiques I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered from bearish investors like Peter Schiff regarding Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies as a whole is that it&amp;rsquo;s intangible. The internet itself is intangible in the same sense, yet everyone uses it without thinking of the hardware, network layers, and other protocols that facilitate everything we do online. No one calls it a fad anymore, but they used to as well. Blockchain technology will progress in a similar fashion, and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are a new value proposition that ties the tech to a swath of new real-world use cases, and music industry is only one facet of this upcoming economic boom.</description>
