      <description>This is a memorial video for my Stepdad Mike DeBord who passed away following an ultimately fatal motorcycle accident, while riding in Angeles National Forrest, in July of 2017. It showcases VHS Cassettes of family home videos from his side of the family with footage superimposed from the old man&amp;rsquo;s own Instagram account. Photos are keyframed to give them motion similar to the technique Ken Burns uses for photos in his documentaries, and the pace of editing was set to my Dad&amp;rsquo;s own personal anthem: Around Here by Counting Crows.</description>
