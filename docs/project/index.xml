      <description>Are you an artist looking to start your own online business? If you currently only have social media channels to show your work, this Art Shop Solution features a method to automate the sales process, and grouping your work by a product or service category. This project was developed to meet 3 main requirements: a blog, a shop, and no monthly fees. The &amp;lsquo;nice-to-have&amp;rsquo; features of this project are currently in development, but we&amp;rsquo;ve delivered with those requirements a business solution built entirely on the JAMstack concept.</description>

Users would update a directory of creators as well as niche tags on creator profiles to help the community find similar content.
