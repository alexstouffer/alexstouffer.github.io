    <article  id="articleContent" class="post-content">
        <p>Do you remember that episode of The Wonder Years where Kevin Arnold&rsquo;s Dad was finally convinced to sell the old family station wagon? The family loved the allure of trading up to a newer vehicle, but once they began to wash that wagon one last time nostalgia feels slapped at their heartstrings. It&rsquo;s kind of like that the first time you sell your old guitar. You remember your first riffs. Your first band. All the time you spent arguing over what to name the band. Everything. It reminds you of the sentimental value that guitar holds to you. Unfortunately, you&rsquo;ve moved on and the money you could make from its adoption sounds like a better proposition. It&rsquo;s time to send it off to greener pastures.</p>
<p>However, you owe it to &lsquo;ye olde&rsquo; guitar (and the other musical instruments) to spruce them up so the next person will love them at first sight. Appearances will affect the asking price of your instrument and it&rsquo;s also important for your reputation as a seller. Take these steps to prep your guitars to ship-shape condition:</p>
<h3 id="you-will-need">You Will Need:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Wire Cutters</li>
<li>Old T-shirts or Microfiber cloths (low-lint from serveral wash cycles)</li>
<li>Metal Polish</li>
<li>Mineral Oil</li>
<li>New Guitar Strings</li>
<li>Phone Camera</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="step-one-cut-the-old-strings-off">Step One: Cut The Old Strings Off</h3>
<p>It might not be a brand new guitar, but it&rsquo;s new to the customer. Nothing takes away from the feeling of playing that guitar for the first time than to play on filthy strings that affect the sound. Even if it&rsquo;s a cheap $5 pack of strings it&rsquo;ll filter most, if not all, negative responses from your seller (based on guitar value). The first thing you want to do is take a few photos of your guitars hardware. It&rsquo;ll help make sure that things get put back the right way. Next, loosen the strings to relax neck tension and make sure to hold the longer length of strings on the neck side of your cut to avoid any safety hazards. Don&rsquo;t bother putting the new strings on just yet, as you&rsquo;ve only just begun.</p>
<h3 id="step-two-old-guitar-meet-old-t-shirt">Step Two: Old Guitar, Meet Old T-Shirt</h3>
<p>Take a soft cloth with little lint like an old t-shirt and then mix a small amount of water with a dab of dish detergent. Use extra care to ring out any excess moisture to preserve the guitar&rsquo;s body and finish. Then rub down the whole guitar from head to toe. Feel free to use citrus oil on fretboards, but don&rsquo;t use any furniture wood cleaners like pledge or chemical cleaners like windex as they contain harmful additives that could damage the guitar finish and ultimately affect its pricing.</p>
<h3 id="step-three-polish-the-metal-to-a-shine">Step Three: Polish The Metal to a Shine</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s not recommended that you use metal polish on pickups with plastic housing, but I&rsquo;ve found that using a few small q-tips and small amounts of Brasso allow me to polish individual magnets without affecting the plastic housing&rsquo;s shine. It&rsquo;s been usefull when the metal begins to grey or even rust. The same tools also help to polish screw heads, and I use a microfiber cloth on other larger metal components while being careful to get any on the finish. If for some reason you are unable to get any metal polish, you can remove rust from metal hardware by using distilled white vinegar on that hardware and scrubbing it with crumpled sheet of aluminum foil. It may take some elbow grease to remove the greyed look from metal, but it will at least remove any rust from the part. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it for pickups because you never mix liquids and electronics.</p>
<h3 id="step-four-use-mineral-oil-to-condition-your-fretboard">Step Four: Use Mineral Oil to Condition Your Fretboard</h3>
<p>Let me refer you to this <a href="https://medium.com/tonebase/how-to-clean-and-oil-your-fingerboard-guitar-care-101-ft-garrett-lee-3-of-7-9abed54f3b51#:~:text=If%20your%20fingerboard%20is%20free,wipe%20it%20on%20the%20frets.">Luthier&rsquo;s Guide</a> for oiling your fretboard if you&rsquo;d like some detailed info, but simply put you&rsquo;ll want to put a light coat of mineral oil on the frets for about 5 minutes and then remove the oil with paper towels using a buffing motion. For harder gunk you can use the abrasive part of a sponge with some mineral oil. Don&rsquo;t worry about the frets. Any oil that drips onto the neck should be removed with a clean paper towel.</p>
<h3 id="step-five-put-new-strings-on">Step Five: Put New Strings On</h3>
<p>Start with the thickest gauge string and work your way through. Take your string and thread it through the bridge and up the neck to the headstock. I like to cut the string at about 1 1/2 times length of distance between the tuning heads. Turn the tuning knob so that the string is being wound from the center out. Once the slack begins to tighten up make sure that the string is sitting on the bridge and nut as normally intended. Get every string on before you tune every string, and then you&rsquo;re done and ready to send it on to its next home.</p>
<p>Not interested in doing the work or missing the supplies? I&rsquo;m happy to include a proper cleaning and restring if needed when you ship with me.</p>
